# Optimization-of-Automotive-Kit-Item

## Business Problem:
Automotive Manufacturer is facing difficulty in effectively sourcing and providing unique Kit Items (Automotive parts) from various vendors to meet customer demands.

## Business Solution:
I gathered research papers and relevant datasets related to our problem. I conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using MySQL and Python on a secondary dataset provided by the client to gain initial insights. The data included customer, order and vehicle details followed by the target variable ‘Kit Item’. Then, I cleaned the raw data using MySQL and Python, and performed Graphical Representation before visualizing it in Power BI. Additionally, I utilized Looker Studio to create interactive dashboards.

## Technology Stack: 
### 1. For Data Visualization: 
 Power Bi. 
 Looker Studio. 

### 2. For EDA and Data Preprocessing:
 Python: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, AutoViz and SweetViz.
 MySQL. 

## Business Benefits: 
 Minimize the delayed delivery of Kit by at least 10%.
 Increase the revenue by at least 20 lacs INR by reducing the delivery delay rate.
